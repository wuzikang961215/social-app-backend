# MongoDB Atlas Backup Setup Guide

## Automatic Backups with MongoDB Atlas

Since you're using MongoDB Atlas (based on your connection string), you have access to built-in backup features.

### 1. Enable Cloud Backups

1. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Navigate to your cluster
3. Click on "Backup" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Enable Cloud Backup"

### 2. Configure Backup Schedule

Atlas provides:
- **Continuous backups** with point-in-time recovery
- **Snapshot frequency**: Every 6 hours
- **Retention**: 
  - Daily snapshots: 7 days
  - Weekly snapshots: 4 weeks
  - Monthly snapshots: 12 months

### 3. Set Up Backup Alerts

1. Go to Project Settings > Alerts
2. Add alert for:
   - Backup failures
   - Restore operations
   - Storage quota warnings

### 4. Test Restore Process

**Important**: Test your restore process regularly!

1. Go to Backup tab
2. Select a snapshot
3. Click "Restore"
4. Choose restore options:
   - Download backup
   - Restore to new cluster
   - Restore to same cluster (be careful!)

### 5. Additional Backup Script (Local)

For extra safety, here's a script for local backups:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backup.sh

# Configuration
MONGODB_URI="your-mongodb-uri"
BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backups"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Create backup
mongodump --uri="$MONGODB_URI" --out="$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$DATE"

# Compress backup
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$DATE.tar.gz" -C "$BACKUP_DIR" "backup_$DATE"

# Remove uncompressed backup
rm -rf "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$DATE"

# Delete backups older than 30 days
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "backup_*.tar.gz" -mtime +30 -delete

echo "Backup completed: backup_$DATE.tar.gz"
```

### 6. Backup Best Practices

1. **Regular Testing**: Test restore process monthly
2. **Multiple Locations**: Keep backups in different regions
3. **Encryption**: Ensure backups are encrypted
4. **Access Control**: Limit who can perform restores
5. **Documentation**: Document restore procedures
6. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for backup failures

### 7. Data Export for Users

Consider implementing data export features:
- Allow users to export their own data (GDPR compliance)
- Implement bulk export for administrators
- Regular audit of data access logs

### 8. Disaster Recovery Plan

1. **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: How quickly you need to restore
2. **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: How much data loss is acceptable
3. **Contact List**: Who to contact during disasters
4. **Runbook**: Step-by-step recovery procedures
